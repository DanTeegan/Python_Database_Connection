### Welcome to this repository. Here you can find information about connecting to databases using python

#### - Welcome to the README of Database Connection presentations:
#### - This is a repository to represent the connection and its integration between database and python. 
#### - Three main files are shown in this repository: main.py, queries.py and output.py.
#### - Using inheritance, importing the connection file to the queries to the output, allows a smooth transition of code and allows an easier interface for the user.
#### - Using input, main queries determines the output of the user and follows a list of methods executing query results. Each of these include fetchmany, fetchall and fetchone. Each of these executions have a separate output, demonstrating the various use of SQL in python commands, including the average product price. 
#### - The outputmain.py file imports code from the queries and calls the function, making it into a separate file allows easier use of accessibility for the user.
