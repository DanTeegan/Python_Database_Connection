### Welcome to the README of Daniels Database Connection project presentation:

##### This repository was created in order to demonstrate the ability to integrate SQL databases and Python.
##### This Project uses some principles of OOP such as Inheritance and abstraction in order to hide the complexity from the user.
##### The files in this project are as followed:
- main.py
- querys.py
- output.py

##### By using the pillar of inheritance, it allowed us to create a link between our classes. Therefore inheriting the relevent data needed.
##### Inheritance is also essential for allowing the queries to run from the main file which holds the database connection.
##### In the queries file, I have tried to demonstrate the benefits of using fetchone, fetchall and fetchmany.
##### Abstraction is used in the output file. This hides the complexity from the user.
##### By using Abstraction it allows for all the queries to be present on a seperate file, enhancing the accessibility for the user.
